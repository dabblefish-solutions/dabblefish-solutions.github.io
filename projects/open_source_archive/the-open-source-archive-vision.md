# The Open Source Archive
## A Cultural History of Free Software

**Tagline:** *The stories, philosophies, and people behind the code that shaped computing.*

**Target URL:** `www.dabblefish.com/projects/open_source_archive/`

## Vision

The Open Source Archive is not a software directory. It's a **cultural publication** that treats open source software with the same reverence that the Public Domain Review gives to classic literature and art.

We believe that:
- **Code is culture.** The decisions embedded in software shape how billions of people work, create, and connect.
- **Open source has heroes.** The people who gave away their life's work deserve to be remembered.
- **Philosophy matters.** The debates between free software and open source, copyleft and permissive, cathedral and bazaar — these are intellectual movements as significant as any in the humanities.
- **History is being lost.** The stories behind pivotal software are scattered across mailing lists, forgotten blog posts, and the memories of aging hackers.

| Categories: Database, Editor, Game | Themes: Liberation, Craft, Rebellion, Collaboration |
| Utility-first | Story-first |
| Comprehensive listings | Curated canon |

## Editorial Voice

### Tone
- **Reverent but not hagiographic** — We admire the work, but acknowledge flaws
- **Accessible** — No assumed knowledge; explain context for newcomers
- **Story-driven** — Lead with narrative, not feature lists
- **Historically grounded** — Primary sources, oral histories, archives
- **Philosophically engaged** — Take the ideas seriously

### What We're NOT
- A download portal
- A "Top 10 Best Free Software" listicle farm
- An advocacy site for any particular license
- A news site covering releases and updates

### Sample Opening Paragraphs

**Bad (utility-focused):**
> "SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. It is the most widely deployed database in the world."

**Good (story-focused):**
> "In the spring of 2000, D. Richard Hipp was working on a battleship for General Dynamics when he got frustrated with Informix. The database kept going down, taking his software with it. 'I'll just write my own,' he thought — a sentence that has preceded both disaster and brilliance in equal measure. Twenty-five years later, SQLite runs on every smartphone on Earth, in every web browser, in every copy of Windows and macOS. It may be the most deployed software ever written. And Hipp gave it all away — not under the GPL, not under MIT, but into the public domain itself."

## Design Direction

### Aesthetic
- **Dark, atmospheric** — Like the terminal, like late-night coding
- **Typographically rich** — Monospace for code, serifs for prose
- **Minimal chrome** — Let the content breathe
- **Archival feel** — Old photographs, scanned documents, commit logs

### Visual Elements
- Screenshots of historical software
- Photos of key figures
- Scanned documents (licenses, manifestos)
- Terminal output as design element
- Commit graphs and timelines
- ASCII art (where appropriate)

### Color Palette
```
Background:     #0d1117 (GitHub dark)
Surface:        #161b22
Border:         #30363d
Text Primary:   #e6edf3
Text Secondary: #8b949e
Accent:         #58a6ff (link blue)
Accent Alt:     #3fb950 (terminal green)
Warning:        #d29922 (gold/amber)
```

### Typography
```
Headings:       "IBM Plex Serif" or "Literata"
Body:           "IBM Plex Sans" or "Source Sans Pro"
Code/Terminal:  "IBM Plex Mono" or "JetBrains Mono"
```

### Inspiration
- Public Domain Review's editorial elegance
- Stripe's documentation aesthetics
- The Long Now Foundation's sense of temporal scale
- Gwern.net's depth and rigor

We occupy the bottom-right quadrant: **cultural, not utilitarian**.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose name and URL structure**
2. **Build static site template** (dark theme, typography-focused)
3. **Write first 3 pieces** to establish voice:
   - SQLite (philosophy)

   - Linux (origin story)
4. **Soft launch** with those 3 + project index
5. **Iterate based on feedback**
